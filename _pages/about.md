Hello👋! This is Wenjie Wei. I am currently a Ph.D. student (from fall 2022) in <a href="https://www.scse.uestc.edu.cn/en/" style="text-decoration: none;">the School of Computer Science and Engineering</a> at <a href="https://en.uestc.edu.cn/" style="text-decoration: none;"> the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China</a> (Chengdu, Sichuan). I am supervised by Prof. <a href="https://www.scse.uestc.edu.cn/info/1081/12350.htm" style="text-decoration: none;">Malu Zhang（张马路）</a>. Prior to joining UESTC, I obtained my Bachelor’s degree from <a href="http://international.zzu.edu.cn/" style="text-decoration: none;">Zhengzhou University</a> in 2021.

My research interests broadly encompass Brain-inspired Computing, Spiking Neural Networks, Model Compression, Neuromorphic Vision, etc. I have published more than 20 papers at the top international AI conferences/journals with a total Google Scholar citations <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DhtAFkwAAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url={{ url | url_encode }}&logo=Google%20Scholar&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a>.
